# p2p.chat

p2p.chat is a peer-to-peer video conferencing application. Think of it as an free and open source appear.in alternative.

## Architecture

p2p.chat uses WebRTC to power all video/data communication between peers. Each p2p.chat room creates a unique WebRTC swarm, using [webrtc-swarm](https://github.com/mafintosh/webrtc-swarm). This means all peers communicate to all other peers directly, without the need to pass data between any kind of centralized server. This ensures that all video data is end-to-end encrypted.

A [signalhub](https://github.com/mafintosh/signalhub) is used as a signalling server to initially connect the peers together.
