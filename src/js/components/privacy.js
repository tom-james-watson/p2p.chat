          This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
          collected, used, and shared when you visit https://p2p.chat (the
          “Site”).
        </p>

        <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

        <p>
          When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
          about your device, including information about your web browser, IP
          address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your
          device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information
          about the individual web pages or products that you view, what
          websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
          about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
          automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
        </p>

        <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
            including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
            referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

        <p>
          We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
          potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
          generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating
          analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site,
          and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
        </p>

        <p>
          We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use
          your Personal Information, as described above. For example, we use
          Cloudflare as a CDN and for DDOS protection -- you can read more about
          how Cloudflare uses your Personal Information here:
          https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with
          applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search
          warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to
          otherwise protect our rights.
        </p>

        <h3>DO NOT TRACK</h3>

        <p>
          Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use
          practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.
        </p>

        <h3>YOUR RIGHTS</h3>

        <p>
          If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal
          information we hold about you and to ask that your personal
          information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to
          exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information
          below. Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we
          are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might
          have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or
          otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.
          Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred
          outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.
        </p>

        <h3>CHANGES</h3>

        <p>
          We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to
          reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other
          operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
